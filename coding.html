                  <p class="color-white">
                    Designing a website with a mobile-first approach is essential in today's digital era. Prioritizing mobile design ensures optimal user experience across all screen sizes, addressing the needs of the majority of internet users who access content via mobile devices.<span class="hidden-text"> By starting with the smallest screen and focusing on essential content and functionality, designers create streamlined layouts that translate seamlessly to larger screens. This approach promotes accessibility, aligns with search engine algorithms, and leads to faster load times, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and website performance. Ultimately, a mobile-first mindset future-proofs websites against the evolving digital landscape, ensuring they remain relevant and effective in reaching and engaging users across various devices.</span>

                  <h6 class="color-white">Tablet View</h6>
                  <p class="color-white">
                    After designing for mobile, the next best layout to prioritise is the tablet layout. Tablets often have larger screens than smartphones but smaller than desktops, making them an important intermediate step in the responsive design process.<span class="hidden-text"> By prioritising both mobile and tablet layouts, designers can create a responsive website that caters to a wide range of devices and screen sizes, maximising accessibility and user satisfaction.</span>

                  <h6 class="color-white">Desktop</h6>
                  <p class="color-white">
                    After ensuring an optimal mobile and tablet layout, the next crucial step in website design is the desktop view. Desktop computers often offer larger screens and more processing power, allowing for more complex layouts and richer user experiences.<span class="hidden-text"> Designing for desktops involves maximizing screen real estate, optimizing navigation menus, and enhancing visual elements such as images and videos. By prioritizing the desktop layout, designers can create immersive and engaging experiences that take full advantage of the capabilities of larger screens. This ensures that users accessing the website from desktop computers enjoy a seamless and visually stunning experience, further enhancing user satisfaction and driving engagement.</span>
